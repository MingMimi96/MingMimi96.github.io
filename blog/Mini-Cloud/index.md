## Product Introduction
Mini Cloud CalorieScan is an innovative intelligent diet assistant that uses AI image recognition technology to automatically analyze the calories and nutrients in daily diets. Users simply need to say "take a photo", and they can obtain a clear calorie report, making health management as effortless as a journey in the cloud. We named it "Mini Cloud" because we hope it can help every user relieve the burden of record-keeping and make every day's dietary choices light, simple, and free.
